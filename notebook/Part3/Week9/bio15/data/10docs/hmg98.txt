To facilitate gene finding and for the investigation of 
human molecular genetics on a genome scale, we 
present a comprehensive survey on various statistical 
features of human exons. We first show that human 
exons with flanking genomic DNA sequences can be 
classified into 12 mutually exclusive categories. This 
classification could serve as a standard for future 
studies so that direct comparisons of results can be 
made. A database for eight categories (related to 
human genes in which coding regions are split by 
introns) was built from GenBank release 87.0 and 
analyzed by a number of methods to characterize statistical 
features of these sequences that may serve as 
controls or regulatory signals for gene expression. The 
statistical information compiled includes profiles of 
signals for transcription, splicing and translation, various 
compositional statistics and size distributions. 
Further analyses reveal novel correlations and constraints 
among different splicing features across an internal 
exon that are consistent with the Exon Definition 
model. This information is fundamental for a quantitative 
view of human gene organization, and should be invaluable 
for individual scientists to design human molecular 
genetics experiments. 

INTRODUCTION 

Almost all the nuclear genes coding for proteins in eukaryotes are 
split into exon and intron sequences. Thus questions such as ¡®what 
makes an exon an exon?¡¯ and ¡®how is an exon recognized by the 
gene expression machinery?¡¯ are of major importance to the 
understanding of gene expression and regulation. The task of 
delineating exon.intron organization is even more challenging in 
vertebrates than in lower eukaryotes because an average vertebrate 
gene consists of multiple small exons separated by introns 
that are 10 or 100 times larger. As the Human Genome Project 
enters a large-scale sequencing phase, identifying exons has also 
become a bottle-neck in genome annotation. In the early 1980s, 
the splicing site consensus (1) and the weight matrix method (2) 
were developed by DNA sequence comparisons. Senapathy et al. 

(3) later compiled more comprehensive sequence statistics on 
major categories of GenBank release 57.0. The statistical features 
of promoters (4) and exon/intron size distributions (5,6) have also 
been studied carefully for vertebrates. There have been many 
good reviews on important aspects of gene recognition methods 
(7.9) and on assessment of different protein-coding measures 
(10). 
To take advantage of a much larger set of human-specific 
sequence data available today, to facilitate experiments on human 
molecular genetics and to meet the need for developing better 
human exon recognition methods, we have extended our 
statistical analysis of fission yeast genes (11) to human exons and 
their flanking regions. Recently, accumulating experimental 
evidence has led to the Exon Definition model (12), which argues 
that, in vertebrate pre-mRNAs with large introns, the initial 
recognition unit of splicing is an exon defined by the interactions 
of splicing factors across the exon. This implies that splicing 
signals may be correlated across an exon and they cannot be 
recognized as independent sequence features. In this survey, we 
report our results on systematic analyses of many individual 
features, and we demonstrate the existence of some novel 
correlations and constraints among different features that may be 
relevant to human exon recognition and to understanding of gene 
expression and regulation. As the central theme in molecular 
biology is the structure.function relationship, distinct statistical 
sequence structures can often suggest, or ought to be explained 
by, their functions. Putting various gene sequence information in 
one place will help to speed up this functional interpretation. 

EXON CLASSIFICATION 

Exons are classified into the following 12 categories (Fig. 1), 
according mainly to what transcriptional or translational boundaries 
an exon contains [we shall refer to the poly(A) site as the end 
of the last exon]: (1) a 5uexon is the 54-terminal untranslated exon 
in a gene; (2) a 3uexon is the 34-terminal untranslated exon; (3) 
a 5utexon is the 54-terminal exon having a 54-untranslated region 
(54UTR) followed by a coding sequence (CDS); (4) a 3tuexon is 
the 34-terminal exon having a 34UTR following a CDS; (5) an 
iutexon is an internal exon having a 34 portion of the 54UTR 
followed by a CDS; (6) an ituexon is an internal exon having a 5¡Ç 
portion of 34UTR following a CDS; (7) an iuexon is an internal 
untranslated exon; (8) an itexon is an internal translated exon. An 
exon in categories 9 and 10 has to contain the complete CDS: (9)

exclusive classes. On the top, a schematic gene model is depicted which 
indicates how some types of exons may be organized in a gene. 

a 5utuexon does not contain the transcriptional end; (10) a 
3utuexon does not contain the transcriptional start; (11) a 
5.3utuexon contains both; and (12) an iutuexon contains neither. 
Because of annotational ambiguities in distinguishing between 
truly intronless CDSs and mRNAs, all the analyses reported in 
this study were done for the first eight categories, which consist 
of 271 5uexons, 38 3uexons, 482 5utexons, 553 3tuexons, 174 
iutexons, 69 ituexons, 34 iuexons and 3440 itexons. Up until now, 
the focus of study has been mainly itexons, for obvious reasons. 
As the human genome will be completely sequenced, it is time to 
address issues related to all types of exons. This is the first 
systematic classification of exons which could serve as a standard 
for future studies so that direct comparison of results can be made. 

STATISTICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF INDIVIDUAL 
SEQUENCE FEATURES 

Size and compositional characteristics 

Exon size distributions. The size distributions of exons that have 
a definite size (no ¡®>¡¯or ¡®<¡¯ in their annotation) in the different 
categories as well as the corresponding quantile statistics are 
plotted in Figure 2. These results indicate that, in general, 
5utexons or iuexons are relatively short (mostly <100 nt) and 

3tuexons and 3uexons are relatively long (mostly .300.500 nt). 
While itexon sizes have a tight log-normal distribution centered 
around log10 (130 nt), the sizes of 3uexons are extremely 
heterogeneous (all >100 nt). There also seems to be a sharp 
drop-off for iutexon sizes >200 nt and for 3uexon sizes <100 nt. 
The extreme values, although somewhat dependent upon the data 
set, do give some idea about possible size constraints. There 
seems to be no minimum constraint on the size of an itexon: we 
found the smallest (4 nt) was the exon 3 of the human TNNI1 gene 
in the initial human exon data set, although, after the data cleaning 
process, the minimum in our final itexon collection was 15 nt. 
These distributions are very useful, for example in comparative 
studies or in exon-trapping experimental designs. 

Coding fraction and UTR distributions. The coding fraction is 
defined as the ratio of the CDS size over the exon size. The 
histograms of the coding fractions of the exons in four categories 
are plotted in Figure 3. These data clearly suggest that (i) 
translation is equally likely to start anywhere in the first exon, but 
it is more likely to start near the beginning of an internal exon; (ii) 
translation is more likely to stop near the beginning of the last exon, 
but it is more likely to stop near the end of an internal exon. At this 
point, one could only speculate on the biological implications. For 
example, why do most ituexons terminate translation near their 
ends? It is known that premature termination codons (PTCs) 
upstream of the distal third of penultimate exons trigger transcript 
degradation while more 34 PTCs fail to signal transcript targeting 
(13). Could this be a mechanism to prevent bona fide termination 
codons from being recognized as ¡®premature¡¯? 

A total of 410 54UTRs and 432 34UTRs (these numbers are 
different from those in exon size distributions because no definite 
boundary at the CDS end of the exon is required) were extracted 
in full length from 5utexons and 3tuexons, respectively. Their 
distributions and the quantile statistics are also plotted in Figure 

3. In the human GLA gene for a-D-galactosidase A (X14448), the 
minimum 34UTR (.2 nt in our definition) results from the fact that 
the CDS (including the stop codon) ends at 11 268 and the 
poly(A) site is at 11 266. UTR size distributions are useful, for 
example, when analyzing human expressed sequence tags (ESTs) 
and cDNA clones. 
Mono- and dinucleotide compositions. Because compositional 
measures depend on the G+C content of the isochore (14) in 
which a gene is residing, for convenience, we compiled the 
statistics separately for data from low GC (<0.5) and high GC 
(.0.5) genomic loci. The average G+C content of our data set is 
0.53, but the average G+C content of all genomic loci from which 
our data set was extracted is only 0.49. The fundamental mono-
and dinucleotide compositions in Table 1 are for the following 
groups of sequences: upstream flanks (216 nt), upstream UTRs, 
upstream introns (54 nt), CDS in each frame, downstream introns 
(54 nt), downstream UTRs and downstream flanks (216 nt). The 
values are represented as the percentage difference relative to the 
average of the total data set. 

In contrast to the averages, some of the salient features are 
given below. At low GC loci, the average G+C contents of the 
various genomic regions have the following order: uutr>uflk> 
average cds>din>dflk>dutr>uin (see Table 1 for the notations). A 
codon has a consensus of RWY (in IUPAC ambiguity codes). At 
high GC loci, the average G+C contents of intron elements are 
boosted in such a way that the new order becomes:

G-string excess, see later discussions) is only associated with high Codon usage. The trinucleotide statistics are presented as in the

(CUG, GAR and AAG) are related to dominant dinucleotides in 
the first coding frame (GA, AA for genes at low GC loci, and CU, 
GA for genes at high GC loci). The least abundant codons (NUA 
and NCG) are related to the rare dinucleotide at the second 
position (CG for genes at low GC loci and UA for genes at high 
GC loci). There are other examples, such as the GCC codon for 
alanine and the CAG codon for glutamine, that have strong 
isochore bias. The most abundant amino acids (leucine and 
serine) are the ones that have most codons and have no rare 
dinucleotide at the first position. Stop codon UAA is particularly 
avoided for genes at high GC loci, although all three stop codons 
are used equally for genes at low GC loci. 

Hexamer (6-tuple) statistics. Hexamer frequency has been used 
widely as a major discriminant factor in exon/intron identification 
(10,16). We have calculated hexamer frequencies fexon (from all 

the CDSs in all frames) and fintron (from the introns of 43 
complete sequenced genes). The ratio fexon/fintron for human is 
less discriminating than in the fission yeast (11) because the 
human splice sites are more degenerate (see the splicing signals 
later). In Figure 4, the dot charts of some extreme ranking 
frequency differences are depicted separately for low and high 
G+C loci. Most of the intron characteristics can be explained by 
the run of Ts or As. However, at high GC loci, the presence of CA 
repeats and G-strings is apparent, especially the complementary 
pair GGGAGG/CCTCCC, which occurs much more often in 
introns. In the coding regions, the information is dominated by the 
hexamers consisting of frequent codons (especially in tandem 
repeat) that are also highly biased by the G+C content. Both 
codon usage and hexamer statistics are very useful, for example, 
when choosing appropriate restriction enzymes or designing 
various probes.

Total number of codons: 98 392/136 953 from low/high G+C sequences. 

Signal profiles 

All the signal profiles reported below are essential in delineating 
human gene organization. They also provide information about 
factor-binding energies around recognition sites (17). 

Promoter signals. Human promoter sequences are difficult to 
identify and are poorly annotated in the public databases. We used 
a refining procedure to obtain the various promoter signal profiles 
(Table 3), where the vertebrate scores of Bucher (4) were used as 
the initial approximate matrices (their positional coordinates 
were also adopted). The windows and the number of sequences 
used in the search are shown, together with the mean distance of 
the signals from the transcriptional start (CAAT and GC boxes 
were searched on both strands). This simple refining procedure 
was able to produce reasonable promoter signal profiles consistent 
with the well-known consensus (4). Of course, genes that have 
no TATA or CAAT box would have contributed ¡®noise¡¯ to the 
profile frequencies (such noise could be reduced by imposing a 
minimum score requirement, as was done for the branch site 
profile below). As mentioned in (4), we also found a 1 nt shift in 
the human Cap-site annotations. Measuring from the end of a box, 
the TATA box is found ~25 nt and the CAAT box ~100 nt (with 
larger deviations) upstream from the transcriptional start site. 

Pre-mRNA 34 end processing signals. The AATAAA box and the 
poly(A) site profiles are shown in Table 4. The first AATAAA box 
profile was obtained by aligning all of the annotated poly(A) 
signals. The second was obtained from a subset of the signals that 
occur within a 50 nt window upstream of the poly(A) site. The 
second profile allowed us to estimate the mean distance (16 nt) 
between the T in the box to the poly(A) site. The first poly(A) site 
profile was also obtained simply from aligning all of the 
annotated poly(A) sites. Due to the uncertainty in identifying a 
precise poly(A) site, we do not see the CA consensus from this 

profile. In an attempt to correct some possible errors, we 
re-aligned the sequences if there was a CA within a ¡¾2 nt distance 
from the annotated poly(A) site. We believe this poly(A) site 
profile (shown at the bottom of the table) may be closer to the 
truth. 

Translational signals. Both the translational start and stop profiles 
were obtained by aligning the corresponding sequences according 
to the annotations (to avoid possible errors, only the consensus 
sequences starting with ATG or ending with one of the three stop 
codons were compiled; Table 5). The human translational start 
profile is consistent with the general consensus for all vertebrates: 
GCCGCCRCCATGG (18). From 531 sequences, we also found 
that start codons occurred as the first, second, third or fourth ATG 
in the open reading frame (ORF) 474, 51, five and one times, 
respectively [which would be in favor of the ¡®first ATG rule¡¯ and 
is very similar to our previous finding for the fission yeast (11)]. 
The translational stop profile shows the ratio among different stop 
codons as TAA:TAG:TGA ~1:1:2 (obtained from TAA+TAG 
~TGA and TAA+TGA ~3 TAG according to the matrix at 
positions .2 and .1), which may also be seen from Table 2. 

Splicing signals. The 54 and 34 splice site profiles were obtained 
by aligning annotated sequences obeying the GT.AG rule (Table 
6). We also did separate profiles for the splice sites adjacent to 
UTR and those adjacent to CDS; we did not find any substantial 
differences (data not shown). From the general mononucleotide 
compositional analysis above, it was shown that the compositional 
property in the flanking intron regions depends strongly on 
the G+C content. One could get more insight by comparing 
splicing signal profiles for low and high G+C content; Table 6 is 
such a comparison calculated from itexons. Although the human 
splice site consensus more or less agrees with the general 
consensus for most vertebrates, AG|GTRAGT for the 54ss and

(Y)nNCAG|G for the 34ss, the G+C content greatly affects the 
nature of purine or pyrimidine constituents. At low G+C loci, the 
54ss consensus may be better described as AG|GTAAGT and the 
34ss consensus as (Y)nNYAG|G. 

The branch site profile was again obtained by the refining 
method above, where the vertebrate scores (19) were used as the 
initial approximate matrix. We took a window (of size 41 nt) 10 
nt upstream of the 34ss end where most reported branch points 
were found (20). To reduce the noise created by genes that have 
their branch point located outside of the window, we imposed a 
minimum score of 3, corresponding to the 1st quantile of the 
maximum score distribution (the absolute conservation of A at 
the branch point was obtained automatically as a consequence). 
The average distance of the branch point from the 34ss end was 
found to be 26 nt. Again the profile is biased by the G+C content. 
In contrast to the vertebrate consensus CTRAY, YTVAY for the 
low G+C content and CTSAY for the high G+C content may be 
more specific to the human sequence. 

In addition to these conventional measures, we also examined 
many other statistics that may play a role in mRNA splicing. 
Some of these are plotted in Figure 5a.f (all the maximum values 
were limited by the searching window size used). 

We plotted the distribution of the distance from the branch point 
to the 34ss end (Fig. 5a); its quantile statistics are: Min. = 10, 1st 
Qu. = 20, Median = 25, Mean = 26, 3rd Qu. = 32 and Max. = 46. 
Most branch points are located 15.30 bp upstream of the 34ss end. 
Branch points outside this region are suboptimal; this happens in 
many alternatively spliced introns (21). 

We plotted the distribution of the distance from the 54ss end to 
the closest (with respect to the CDS) downstream in-frame stop 
codon (Fig. 5b); its quantile statistics are: Min. = .2, 1st Qu. = 1, 
Median = 11, Mean = 16, 3rd Qu. = 27 and Max. = 51 (.2 occurs 
when the 54ss looks like TA|GT where TAG is the first stop 
¡®masked¡¯ by the 54 ss boundary). The expected number of the first 
downstream stop codons found by chance in random sequences 
at each position is indicated by a dotted line. This is three times 
the expected number of the first in-frame downstream stop 
codons found by chance. The striking peak at 1 gives rise to the 
54ss consensus G|GTRAG, and there is a second peak at position 
5 which may also correspond to a functional role in splicing. The 
fact that most significant stops are very close to the 54ss supports 
the idea that the 54ss may be there originally to mask the 
downstream nonsense codons (22) and to allow longer (and hence 
more complex) gene products to be coded. Many non-functional

All these matrices were obtained by using the corresponding Bucher¡¯s matrices 
as the initial start in the refining procedure (see Database and Methods). 

excess stops would have long ago been washed out by mutations 
in evolution. 

We plotted the distance from the closest upstream AG to the 
34ss AG (Fig. 5c); its quantile statistics are: Min. = 2, 1st Qu. = 
22, Median = 29, Mean = 30, 3nd Qu. = 37 and Max. = 52. We 
can see a sharp drop-off at short distances (<18 nt). Compared 
with Figure 5a, it is clear that the first AG downstream of the 
branch site is most likely to be used as the 34ss. This rule works 
much better for the fission yeast (11). 

To study more flanking intron features quantitatively, we 
looked at the Y-string in polypyrimidine [poly(Y)] tracts of the 3¡Ç 
intron region and the possible G-string excess in the 54 intron 
region. 

The polypyrimidine tract is known to play an important role in 
human pre-mRNA splicing (23). A Y-string is a tandem stretch 
of pyrimidines. We extracted the maximum Y-string (closest to 
the 34ss end) from the 54 nt upstream flanking intron region of 
4417 exons and plotted the size and distance distributions in 
Figure 5d and e. The quantile statistics for the sizes are: Min. 2, 
1st Qu. = 6, Median = 8, Mean = 9, 3rd Qu. = 11, Max. = 32; and 
for the distances are: Min. = 2, 1st Qu. = 4, Median = 9, Mean = 
14, 3rd Qu. = 21, Max. = 50. Compared with the same statistics 
from random sequences having the same nucleotide composition 
(also shown in the figure), we see that the maximum Y-strings 
have a much longer length and occur very close to the 34ss end in 
real introns (a t-test, df = 7899, showed the true mean 9.19 is 
outside of the 95% confidence interval of the random sample 
mean 6.62 ¡¾ 2.45). [A non parametric test (Wilcoxon rank sum) 
test (24) was also performed that definitely ruled out the null 
hypothesis that the medians of the two sample distributions are

the same which had a P-value <10.10.] We expect the size effect 
would be larger if approximate Y-strings were used (allowing one 
mismatch, for example). 

The G-string excess was hinted at in the above discussion of 
mono- and dinucleotide distributions. It was first reported by 
Solovyev et al. (25). We measured this feature in a more 
quantitative way as follows. Using itexons, for each minimum 
G-string size i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), we counted the number of tandem 
G runs of size i and larger in a 54 nt window on each side of the 

Human Molecular Genetics, 1998, Vol. 7, No. 5 927 

54ss boundary. Let the difference of the number on the intron side 
to the exon side be D and d = 1, 0 or .1 depending on whether D 
is >, = or < 0. The average D (unshaded) and d (shaded) are plotted 
in Figure 5f. One can see both measures peaked at 3, indicating 
that G triplets are the most over-represented G-strings on the 
intron side on average. Recent experiments indicated the G 
triplets located throughout a class of small vertebrate introns 
enforce intron borders and regulate splice site selection (26). It is 
possible that such G triplets may be related to hnRNP sites [such 
as hnRNP A1 sites which have a consensus of UAGGGU (27)]. 

CORRELATIONS AND CONSTRAINTS AMONG 
DIFFERENT SEQUENCE FEATURES 

To explore possible relationships among different features across 
an exon, we used itexons that have complete flanking intron 
information. (For convenience of statistical tests, all variables in 
Figure 6a.d were normalized.subtracted the mean and divided 
by the standard deviation.) 

Strong compensatory constraint between the two splice sites 
across a short exon. In Figure 6a, we have plotted the upstream 
34ss score against the downstream 54ss score for each exon (we 
chose 0 as the minimum score cut-off, because the few splice sites 
with negative scores were mostly annotation errors). There 
appears to be no correlation for the whole data set at first sight. 
However, if we highlighted the exons that have a short size (< 61 
nt) and have a relatively long upstream intron (>200 nt), there 
appeared to be a constraint (represented by the dotted line) that 
restricted these exons into the upper-right corner. To test the 
significance of the constraint, we found that the P-value (see 
Database and Methods) was 0.029 (N = 77, the constraint is y = 
.2.8x . 3.5). Therefore, this constraint is statistically significant 
at the 95% confidence level. Such a constraint is consistent with 
the Exon Definition model: both splice sites have to be consensual 
for a short exon not to be skipped and, when the 34ss is weak in 
a long intron, a stronger downstream 54ss is needed to compensate 
for exon definition. Experimentally, it was observed that mutation 
of a 54ss depressed the removal of the upstream intron 20-fold 
(28). Strengthening a naturally weak 54ss of an internal exon by 
making it a better fit to the consensus increased in vitro splicing 
of the upstream intron (29,30). In vivo, mutant 54 splice sites 
usually were suppressed by second mutations that improved the 
34ss across the exon (31,32). 

Correlation between the splice sites and exon size.To see how 
the minimum quality of splice sites depends on exon size, we 
made a box plot of the total splice site score (i.e. the sum of the 
54ss score and 34ss score across an exon) as a function of the 
internal exon size (Fig. 6b, in log10). We observed that when the 
exon size is near the mean or larger, there appears to be no 
restriction on the splice site scores (except the absolute minimum); 
however, when the exon size decreases, the splice site 
scores tend to go up systematically. This is also consistent with 
Exon Definition in the sense that the interacting splicing factors 
across an exon may require an optimal interaction range. 
Experimentally, in addition to exon skipping, the other major 
phenotype resulting from mutation of a splice site in a human 
gene is activation of a cryptic site with the right polarity (33). 
When a constitutively recognized internal exon was internally 
deleted below 50 nt, it was skipped by the in vivo splicing

Figure 5. Novel splice site features. (a) The distance from the branch point to the 34ss is mostly between 15 and 30 bp. (b) The distance from the 54ss to the first 
downstream in-frame nonsense codon is mostly 1 bp. The dotted line indicates the expected number of the first downstream nonsense codon which is three times the 
expected number of the first in-frame downstream nonsense codon. (c) The distance from the 34ss to the first upstream AG is mostly between 18 and 35 bp. (d) The 
poly(Y) tract in the 34 sequence of real introns is larger than would be found by random chance. (The histogram for the random model with the same nucleotide 
composition is cross-hatched.) (e) The distance from the poly(Y) tract to the 34ss is much shorter than would be found by chance. (The histogram for the random model 
is cross-hatched.) (f) G-string excess in the 54ss intron region is mostly G-triplets. D and d are two different statistical measures (see text). The peak at 3 bp indicates 
that G-triplets are more enriched in the 54ss intron region relative to the adjacent upstream exon region.

Figure 6. Correlations and constraints among different sequence features. (a) Scatter plot of 54ss scores versus 34ss scores (both normalized, see text). The highlighted 
dots represent the short exons (<61 bp and flanked by an upstream intron >200 bp). That fact that these highlighted dots are bounded by the dotted line indicates the 
compensatory constraint between minimum qualities of upstream 34ss and downstream 54ss across these short exons. (b) Correlation between the splice site quality 
(measured by the sum of the flanking splice site scores) and the exon size (normalized in log10 scale) is apparent for short exons. (c) The constraint on minimum 
upstream intron size for large exons is indicated by the dotted line. (d) The constraint between the upstream poly(Y) (measured by the normalized ratio of YYY 
frequency to Y frequency) and downstream G-strings (measured by the normalized ratio of GGG frequency to G frequency) is indicated by the dotted line. (e) A 3-tuple 
clustering tendency correlation is indicated by the diagonal stripe in the scatter-plot of the 3-tuple clustering tendency (which measures how likely it is that one would 
find mononucleotide runs) in the upstream flanking intron region versus the downstream flanking intron region. (f) Scatter-plots of A+T contents for the upstream 
flanking intron region versus the downstream flanking intron region, for the exon region versus the whole genomic region and for the total flanking intron region versus 
the whole genomic region are displayed. The A+T content correlations are indicated by the diagonal stripes.

Constraint between the upstream intron size and exon size. To 
prevent steric hindrance between splicing factors, a minimum 
intron size is generally expected. This is the case, as may be seen 
in Figure 6c where the upstream intron size is plotted against the 
exon size (both in log10). With our data set, this minimum was 
24 nt (for the two introns in the human parvalbumin gene); the 
others were 60 nt or larger. Unexpectedly, our data also show a 
restriction at the upper-right corner. Namely, a long exon is often 
accompanied by a short upstream intron. A significance test 
arrived at P = 0.025 (N = 1228, the constraint is y = .x + 3.88), 
implying that the constraint is significant at the 95% level. 
According to the Exon Definition, when the exon size becomes 
very large, the upstream intron may only be recognized through 
the Intron Definition mode (33), which would require a shorter 
intron size (see also ref. 36). 

Constraint between the poly(Y) tract and the downstream 
G-strings. To demonstrate that the G-string feature mentioned 
above is also correlated with the poly(Y) tract, we designed a 
simple measure as follows: for a G-string measure, we counted 
the total size of G-strings (G runs of 3 nt or more) in a 54 nt 
window downstream of a 54ss and normalized it by dividing the 
total number of G residues; we constructed a similar measure for 
the poly(Y) tract by counting the total size of Y-strings 
(pyrimidine runs of 3 nt or more) in a 30 nt window upstream of 
the 34ss and by dividing the total number of pyrimidine residues. 
As shown by the dotted line in Figure 6d, the relationship 
manifests itself again as a constraint: when the G-string content 
downstream of an itexon is too high (>1 on the normalized scale), 
the poly(Y) tract upstream has to be of better quality (more 
Y-triplets clustering). Again the features on the opposite sides of 
an itexon appear to be ¡®talking¡¯ to each other. The P-value for the 
constraint is 0.019 (N = 1586 and the line is y = 1.7x . 5.58), again 
significant at the 95% level. It is possible that the G-strings bind 
the Y-strings across an itexon transiently to help initial exon 
recognition during RNA splicing. 

Correlation of 3-tuple clusterings in the flanking introns. Due to 
runs of As or Ts (as shown, for example, in Fig. 4), most introns 
have less complexity than exons (37). We wanted to see if there 
are any correlations between clusterings in different regions. We 
use x = Rk Nk(Nk . 1)/L . 2 as our 3-tuple clustering measure (this 
measure has been used by Roman Tatusov in his low complexity 
filtering software.dust) where Nk is the number of a 3-tuple k, 
L is the window length and the sum is over all possible (64) 
3-tuples. The larger this number is, the stronger is the 3-tuple 
clustering. We had calculated x for each side of the 34 or 54 splice 
site with a window of length 54 nt; we observed that most of the 
introns have lower clustering tendency than the exons, and there 
were no correlations between different exon regions or between 
an exon region and an intron region (data not shown). However, 
there was a strong correlation between the upstream intron region 
and the downstream intron region for a subset of itexon data (as 
indicated by the diagonal stripe in Fig. 6e). The correlation 
coefficient was cor = 0.84 with a 90% confidence interval of 
(0.825,0.846) (defined in Database and Methods). 

Correlation between flanking A+T contents across an itexon. 
Finally, we show a correlation between mononucleotide compositions 
in the two flanking intron regions (54 nt each) across an 
itexon. We have calculated A+T content in each of the following 
regions: upstream flanking intron, itexon and downstream 
flanking intron, and compared them with the A+T content of their 
genomic locus. We found that the correlation between flanking 
introns across an itexon was the strongest, with cor = 0.78 and a 
90% confidence interval of (0.758,0.802) (as seen in Fig. 6f). 
Presumably this correlation is caused mainly by the isochore 
effect (14), as may be seen from the subplots in Figure 5f, which 
shows that genomic A+T content is clustered into islands and the 
flanking intron A+T content correlates with the genomic more 
positively than the exon A+T content (the straight lines are the 
equal A+T content lines). This correlation is remarkably strong 
because only very short (54 nt) flanking intron sequences were 
used and the poly(Y) or the G-string in these regions would have 
to adjust its composition to accommodate the correlation. In fact, 
all the signal profiles are GC content-dependent as shown earlier. 
That is why exon identification in a low GC locus is very difficult 
as the exon GC content is constrained to be almost as low as 
introns and intergenic regions. 

CONCLUSIONS 

In summary, we have analyzed statistical characteristics of many 
sequence features in human exons and their flanking regions, 
including some very subtle and complex ones. We have begun to 
reveal several novel correlations and constraints among different 
features. Some of these are in accord with recent experimental 
observations; others are still a mystery awaiting functional 
interpretation. We should emphasize that most correlations are 
between extreme values (mathematically, the relationships can 
only be expressed as inequality constraints). For features that are 
close to their consensus, they are quite free to vary and the exon 
will still be defined (recognized). This type of degeneracy is quite 
typical for biological systems (e.g. non-lethal mutations of 
protein sequences are often tolerated because the resulting change 
of a structure is not critical to the function). However, under 
special conditions where the general constraints are violated, the 
exons have to be defined by a delicate balance of multiple features 
and/or a requirement for additional new features [such as the 
secondary structures (38), purine-rich enhancers (39), etc.]. 
These have been observed often in alternatively spliced genes 
(40). All correlations related to gene structures are likely to be 
complex, because they resulted from dynamic interactions of 
many macromolecules during evolution. However, these interdependencies 
among different features are just as important as 
each individual feature. This is analogous to the fact that protein 
function cannot be worked out by structure characterization alone 
without considering interactions between subcomponents or with 
substrates. More rigorously characterizing existing features, 
further discovering new features, and quantitatively exploring 
novel feature relationships will be the keys for understanding 
gene structures and for improving exon discrimination methods. 
Many statistical findings reported here have already been utilized 
in a new gene-finding method (41) which has substantially 
improved the accuracy in human exon prediction. Better understanding 
of the architecture of genes will become the prerequisite 
for innovative experimental designs in functional studies.

Human exons (in nuclear protein-coding genes) were extracted 
from GenBank release 87.0, and the data set was processed to 
remove redundant copies and checked for data integrity. Starting 
with 31 202 human sequences extracted out of gbpri.seq, we 
filtered out viruses, mitochondria, RNAs, pseudogenes, Ig genes, 
MHC genes, redundant large family genes and identical copies. 
Only 6152 sequences remained. Of these, 780 contained complete 
CDSs which belong to the last four categories (see Fig. 1). 
We sorted the rest in ascending order according to their size, and 
extracted all the exons that had no >90% maximum similarity to 
other larger exons. Many errors were removed or corrected during 
the entire analysis by comparison against the original publications. 
The final data set consisted of 5061 exons (representing 
2705 intron-containing genes) belonging to the first eight 
categories (see Fig. 1). These exons and their flanking regions 
(54 nt into introns or 210 nt into intergenic regions) have been 
deposited in FASTA format at the anonymous ftp site 
phage.cshl.org in the directory pub/science/human_exons. The 
accession number and the coding frame information are also 
retained in each exon record. 

All profiles were defined by positional dependent frequency 
matrices (17) 

fx . 
nxN, with N . 
nx, 

where nax is the counts of a k-tuple a at position x. The scores 
were defined by 

sax = log2 (Pax/P0), 

where P0 = (1/4)k (if a is a k-tuple) and Pax isthe Bayesian 
posterior probability (42) given by 

Px . 
(nx . 
a)(N . 
A), with A . 
a. 


We chose the pseudocount aa to be N multiplied by the 
background frequency of a. The counts were obtained either from 
the known alignments or by the following refining procedure. 
Starting with an approximate matrix (we took the corresponding 
vertebrate matrix; one may also take a matrix resulting from a 
known alignment of subset data), align the signals (within a 
specified window) that have the maximum score and calculate the 
new matrix. One then iterates this procedure until it converges. 

To assess a straight line constraint in a plan, we used the normal 
approximation (with a mean of zero and standard deviation of 
unity) by normalizing (subtracting the mean and dividing by the 
standard deviation) the two sample variables xi and yi. (The 
variables may need to be transformed, such as by taking the 
logarithm of exon sizes, so that their distribution can be 
approximated by the normal distribution.) Assuming x, y are 
independent, the null hypothesis is that the observed N points are 
not restricted by a straight line (generalization to an arbitrary 
curve is straight forward) y = ax + b. The probability f of finding 
one point in the restricted region is given by F(d), where F is the

ais the distance 
of the constraint line from the origin. The P-value for finding all 
N points on one side of the constraint is fN. 

The definition of the correlation coefficient cor of two vectors 
of sample data X,Y, is the standard: 

(X .

where m1, m2 and s1, s2 are the means and standard deviations, 
respectively, of X and Y. The confidence interval for cor is 
obtained by the procedure described in (43). 

Most of the analysis and graphics were done with SPLUS (44).
