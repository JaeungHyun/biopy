      "The data generated from experiments in bioinformatics may contain several dimensions and be quite complicated. However, the dimensionality of the data may far exceed its complexity. A reduction in dimensionality often allows simpler algorithms to analyze the data effectively. The most common method of data reduction in bioinformatics is principal component analysis (PCA)."

      "Principal component analysis is an often-used tool that reduces the dimensionality of a problem. Consider a set of vectors that lie in R<sup>N</sup> space. It is possible that the data is not scattered about but has an organization. When looked at in one view, the data looks scattered, but if viewed from a different orientation the data appears more organized. In this case the data does not need to be represented in the full RN space but can be viewed in a reduced dimensional space as represented by this view. PCA is then used to find the coordinate axes that best orient this data, which thus possibly reduces the number of dimensions that are needed to describe the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the following example there are three vectors of data, each with t hree dimensions. The data is three-dimensional, but the first dimension and the third are exactly the same. Thus one dimension is redundant, and in actuality the data is just two-dimensional.\n",
      "X<sub>1</sub> = { 2, 1 , 2 } X<sub>2</sub> = { 3 , 4 , 3 } X<sub>3</sub> = { 5, 6, 5 }\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's consider a more complicated example: a data set that consists of P vectors, each with N elements and N>>P. In this situation a vector v can be written in terms of scalar coefficients: {a<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub>, \u2022 \u2022 . ,a<sub>N</sub>v<sub>N</sub>}. It takes only N samples to compute all of the coefficients a<sub>k</sub>. Yet, there are only P samples, and therefore it is not possible to determine all of the values of the coefficients . Basically, it is the same as the situation above in that some of the elements in the vectors are redundancies of the others. The dimensionality of the problem can be reduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "The PCA approach is equivalent to rotating the coordinates of the space that could make some of the coordinates unimportant. Figure 19-1 shows a set of data points presented in two dimensions. Each data point requires an (x, y) coordinate to locate it in the space.\n",
      "Figure 19-2 shows that same data after rotation. \n",
      "\n",
      "In this case all of the x coordinates of the data are the same, and therefore this coordinate is no longer needed. The only necessary description of the data is the y coordinate. Thus through the process of rotation the dimensionality of the data has been reduced from R<sup>2</sup> to R<sup>1</sup>.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dimensionality can be reduced when one coordinate is very much like another or a linear combination of others. This type of redundancy becomes evident in the covariance matrix , which has the ability to indicate which dimensions are dependent on each other. The covariance matrix of a completely independent system will be diagonal; the covariance matrix of this new space will be as diagonal as possible for this data. If it were completely diagonal, then each data point would be found on an individual axis.\n",
      "\n",
      "For cases in which there are some dependencies, methods such as eigenvectors or SVD (singular valued & decomposition) are used to find a new system that optimally diagonalizes the covariance matrix. Thus before PCA is demonstrated, it is necessary to discuss eigenvectors."

In the PCA process a decision is made to get rid of some of the eigenvectors because they are deemed as not important, thus reducing the dimension. The matrix that is fed into the <b>linalg.eig</b> is the covariance matrix that measures the variance among the different elements in the input vectors. Basically, if element i and element j of the vectors are linked, the element <i>C[i,j]</i> (the covariance matrix) is a larger value.

Thus the covmat is 10 X 10 in this case.\n",

This computation produced eigenvectors and eigenvalues with imaginary components. The imaginary parts of the numbers were on the order of 1e-18, which is 0. Because the data type is still complex, only the real part of the eigenvalues and vectors are used. As shown here, there are four eigenvalues that are not 0.

      "  These four eigenvalues indicate which of the eigenvectors are important. As indicated in Step 3, the other dimensions can be eliminated from further consideration. Consequently, the new space after rotation is only R<sup>4</sup> instead of the original R<sup>10</sup>.\n",
      "  Step 4 requires that the data points be converted into the new space. The location of the data points are computed by projecting them onto the new coordinates, which is the dot product of the data points with the new axes. The first example uses all ten dimensions in the new space to demonstrate that the data points can be converted to the new space and back to the old space. The coefficients <i>cffs</i> in Code 19-5 represent the data points in the new space. Each row in <i>cffs</i> is a vector that locates the data point with respect to the new axes as defined by the eigenvectors. The next two lines convert one of the data points from the new space back to the old space. In this case the conversion is performed for the first data vector (since there is a 0 as the first index for <i>cffs</i>). The vector z should be the same as the original data vector <i>data[0]</i>.The final print shows that this is the case and that the data points have been projected into the new space and then back to the original space without error."

Code 19-7 sets up the problem forcing data[4] to be a linear combination of three other vectors. The covariance matrix is computed and the eigenvectors extracted.

A majority of the data is contained in the principal coordinates (those with the larger eigenvalues). In many applications the data is converted to PCA space and is then organized in a manner that makes it easy to analyze. Unless the analysis requires fine precision, the small errors do not interfere with the analysis.\n",

In Code 19-9 the data from Code 19-8 has a little noise added to it. The same process is run, and the differences are noticeable. To begin with, there are no eigenvalues that are 0 , but there is one that is much smaller than the others and is thus removed. The reproduction of the data in this case is not exact."

Although this system was run for 1,000 time steps, only a few points are visible because it gets into an oscillation. Code 19-18 presents some of the values, showing that there is a regular cycle that repeats every 44 time steps. The hard comers appear because the system forces values to be no greater than 1, which is a nonlinear operation. The comers occur when one of the elements of the state vector drastically exceeds 1 and the nonlinear restriction is employed."
